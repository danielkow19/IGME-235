    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this portfolio will be to help me land a co-op for this summer. That said, due to my preference towards programming over other aspects of game development right now, I tailored the design towards a sleek and smooth aesthetic. I want to be straight and to the point with my skills instead of trying to attract attention to the visual design itself.<br>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Placeholder image dimensions are 350x190, although that shouldn't be completely necessary to adhere to.<br>
        In future, I plan to add social media links and icons (probably using sprite sheets). They'd probably go under "about me" and/or in the footer.
