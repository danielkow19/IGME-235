    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this portfolio will be to help me land a co-op for this summer. That said, due to my preference towards programming over other aspects of game development right now, I tailored the design towards a sleek and smooth aesthetic. I want to be straight and to the point with my skills instead of trying to attract attention to the visual design itself.<br>

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>
        Placeholder images in the "Projects" section are from <a href="https://placeholder.com/">placeholder.com</a><br>
        Typeface is "Noto Sans" found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans">here</a><br>
        Color palette from <a href="https://coolors.co/e8f1f2-ccf5cc-7a9e7e-31493c-001f29">coolors.co</a><br>
        I drew my own avatar, even if its place on this page is temporary.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Placeholder image dimensions are 350x190, although that shouldn't be completely necessary to adhere to.<br>
        If adding more projects to the gallery, the last project only needs the "center" class if there's an odd number of projects. Otherwise, remove it.<br>
        In future, I plan to add social media links and icons (probably using sprite sheets). They'd probably go under "about me" and/or in the footer.
