            <p>
                I am computer programmer, software engineer, graphic designer, and game designer/developer for digital and physical games. First and foremost, I am a problem solver who loves technology, which naturally led me down the self-taught path to programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                When presented with a problem, I try to find the cleanest and most efficient answer. If it turns out that my solution isn't as smooth as I want, I like to keep trying new things until something sticks, and learn from all the mistakes and failed projects along the way. Although this leaves behind a sad graveyard of "could have been" projects, it makes the ones that survive shine that much more
