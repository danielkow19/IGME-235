            "Fools laugh at everything, even at their superiors. But beware, laughter isn't harmless! Laughter spreads like a disease, and soon everyone is laughing at you. You need to strike at the source of this perverse merriment quickly to stop it from spreading."),
            createQuote("Always Be Rested.",
            "Fighting and adventuring take their toll on your body. When you rest, your body strengthens and repairs itself. The longer you rest, the stronger you become."),

            "This precept also explains itself."),
            createQuote("If You Try, Succeed.",

            "Once you have identified your foe's weak point as per the previous precept, strike it. This will instantly destroy them."),
            createQuote("Protect Your Own Weak Point",
            "Be aware that your foe will try to identify your weak point, so you must protect it. The best protection? Never having a weak point in the first place."),
            createQuote("Don't Trust Your Reflection.",
            "When peering at certain shining surfaces, you may see a copy of your own face. The face will mimic your movements and seems similar to your own, but I don't think it can be trusted."),
            createQuote("Eat As Much As You Can.",
            "When having a meal, eat as much as you possibly can. This gives you extra energy, and means you can eat less frequently."),
            createQuote("Don't Peer Into the Darkness.",
            "If you peer into the darkness and can't see anything for too long, your mind will start to linger over old memories. Memories are to be avoided, as per Precept Four."),
            createQuote("Develop Your Sense of Direction.",
            "It's easy to get lost when travelling through winding, twisting caverns. Having a good sense of direction is like having a magical map inside of your head. Very useful."),
            createQuote("Never Accept a Promise.",
            "Spurn the promises of others, as they are always broken. Promises of love or betrothal are to be avoided especially."),

            createQuote("Names Have Power.",
            "Names have power, and so to name something is to grant it power. I myself named my nail 'Life Ender'. Do not steal the name I came up with! Invent your own!"),
            createQuote("Show the Enemy No Respect.",
            "Being gallant to your enemies is no virtue! If someone opposes you, they don't deserve respect or kindness or mercy."),
            createQuote("Don't Eat Immediately Before Sleeping.",
            "This can cause restlessness and indigestion. It's just common sense."),

            createQuote("Spend Geo When You Have It.",
            "Some will cling onto their Geo, even taking it into the dirt with them when they die. It is better to spend it when you can, so you can enjoy various things in life."),
            createQuote("Never Forgive.",
            "If someone asks forgiveness of you, for instance a brother of yours, always deny it. That brother, or whoever it is, doesn't deserve such a thing."),
            createQuote("You Can Not Breathe Water.",
            "Water is refreshing, but if you try to breathe it you are in for a nasty shock."),
            createQuote("One Thing is Not Another.",
            "This one should be obvious, but I've had others try to argue that one thing, which is clearly what it is and not something else, is actually some other thing, which it isn't. Stay on your guard!"),
            createQuote("The World is Smaller Than You Think.",
            "When young, you tend to think that the world is vast, huge, gigantic. It's only natural. Unfortunately, it's actually quite a lot smaller than that. I can say this, now having travelled everywhere in the land."),
            createQuote("Make Your Own Weapon.",
            "Only you know exactly what is needed in your weapon. I myself fashioned 'Life Ender' from shellwood at a young age. It has never failed me. Nor I it."),
            createQuote("Be Careful With Fire.",
            "Fire is a type of hot spirit that dances about recklessly. It can warm you and provide light, but it will also singe your shell if it gets too close."),
            createQuote("Statues are Meaningless.",
            "Do not honour them! No one has ever made a statue of you or I, so why should we pay them any attention?"),
            createQuote("Don't Linger on Mysteries.",
            "Some things in this world appear to us as puzzles. Or enigmas. If the meaning behind something is not immediately evident though, don't waste any time thinking about it. Just move on."),
            createQuote("Nothing is Harmless.",
            "Given the chance, everything in this world will hurt you. Friends, foes, monsters, uneven paths. Be suspicious of them all."),
            createQuote("Beware the Jealousy of Fathers.",
            "Fathers believe that because they created us we must serve them and never exceed their capabilities. If you wish to forge your own path, you must vanquish your father. Or simply abandon him."),

            createQuote("Bow to No-one.",
            "There are those in this world who would impose their will on others. They claim ownership over your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts!They have done nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey their commands."),
            createQuote("Do Not Dream.",
